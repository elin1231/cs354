For all cache simulations, use a capacity of 16384 bytes, and set associativity of 1, for both 
the I-cache and the D-cache.

Sample command line:
pin-fw/pin -injection child -t pin-fw/source/tools/Memory/obj-ia32/allcache.so -is 16384 -ia 1 -ib 64 -ds 16384 -da 1 -db <block-size> -- <yourexe>

1.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 4 bytes?

	Data cache misses:
	Data cache references:

1.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 4 bytes?
	

2.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 32 bytes?

	Data cache misses:
	Data cache references:

2.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 32 bytes?


3.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes?

	Data cache misses:
	Data cache references:

3.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?


4. For this question, assume that the 100,000 element integer array that you allocated starts at address 0x50000000 in memory, the size of an integer is 4 bytes and the D-cache is initially empty. As you read the integers in the array one-by-one, starting at index 0, how many D-cache misses will you see for reading the first 40 integers when the cache block size is (to be answered without running pin):

a) 4 bytes:
	
b) 32 bytes:
	
c) 64 bytes:

8. For this question, assume that the 2-D integer array you allocated starts at address 0x40000000 in memory, the size of an integer is 4 bytes, D-cache block size is 64 bytes and the D-cache is initially empty. As you read the integers in the 2-D array one-by-one, starting with element array[0,0], how many D-cache misses will you see for reading the first 10 integers in case of (to be answered without running pin):

a) cache2Drows:

b) cache2Dcols:

9. Compare the performance (hit ratio) of the D-cache for the 2 programs. Briefly explain what you observe.
