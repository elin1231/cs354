Learning Goals:

The purpose of this assignment is to gain insight into the asynchronous nature of interrupts, handling signals, and expanding C programming skills. By their very definition, signals occur at times not connected to the running program; this makes them asynchronous.

A Periodic Alarm: intdate.c & sigsend.c:

In this section you will be writing two programs called intdate.c and sendsig.c. The first program will handle: periodic signals from an alarm, a keyboard interrupt signal and a user defined signal. The second program will be used to send signals to other programs.

Divide by Zero: division.c:

Write a program division.c that does the following in an infinite loop:
• Prompt for and read in one integer value
• Prompt for and read in a second integer value
• Calculate the quotient and remainder of doing the integer division operation: int1 / int2
• Print these results
• Keep a total count of how many division operations were successfully completed.
